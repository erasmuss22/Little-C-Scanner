&   the scanner returns && instead of a single &
ID  the scanner reads in leading underscores as illegal chars, so _int3 becomes int3
charnum  For a string, charnum does not increase at all. It only increases by the whitespace between strings and not the length of the string
COMMENT  For a comment, charnum does not increase at all, just like the string problem
Unterminated String  An unterminated string followed by EOF does not produce an error
""  the empty string returns as a string with a bad escaped character despite having "zero or more string characters in double quotes
