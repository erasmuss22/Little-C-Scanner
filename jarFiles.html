<H1>How to Download and use JLex and Java Cup</H1>
<P>
To use JLex and Java Cup on your own computer, you can download
the latest versions from the Internet.
However, the latest version of JLex doesn't allow comments in the
second part of the specification.
This is annoying, and will cause JLex to fail on the provided
skeleton specification.
<P>
A good alternative is to use the <em>jar files</em> in
<UL>
<tt>~cs536-1/public/JAVA</tt>
</UL>
The files are called <tt>JLex.jar</tt> and <tt>java_cup.jar</tt>.
To use them, copy them to your own computer and put them in the
directory (folder) where you plan to write the code for your second
programming assignment.
You can either set your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> to include the current
directory as well as the two jar files, or you can use a
<tt>classpath</tt> flag each time you use JLex to process your
scanner specification and each time you compile the generated scanner.
<P>
<H2>Setting CLASSPATH</H2>
<P>
To set your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> on a Linux machine, type:
<UL>
<tt>setenv CLASSPATH ".:JLex.jar:java_cup.jar"</tt>
</UL>
Then (as long as you continue to work in the same window
and the same directory)
you can simply run JLex and compile the generated
scanner as defined in the <tt>Makefile</tt> that was provided
for program 2:
<UL>
<tt>java JLex.Main Little.jlex</tt><br>
<tt>javac Little.jlex.java</tt>
</UL>
<P>
<H2>Using the classpath flag</H2>
<P>
<H3>Linux</H3>
On a Linux machine, to use the <tt>classpath</tt> flag when you run
JLex on your specification (in a file called <tt>Little.jlex</tt>),
and then to compile the generated scanner, type the following, or put
it into your Makefile:
<UL>
<tt>java -classpath .:JLex.jar:java_cup.jar JLex.Main Little.jlex</tt><br>
<tt>javac -classpath .:JLex.jar:java_cup.jar Little.jlex.java</tt>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Windows</H3>
The CSL says that on Windows machines, the latest jdk does not
add javac to the system path.
So they suggest using something like the following commands, instead
of the ones given for Linux users, above:
<UL>
<tt>java -classpath .;.\JLex.jar;.\java_cup.jar JLex.Main Little.jlex</tt><br>
<tt>Program Files\java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin\javac.exe -classpath .;.\JLex.jar;.\java_cup.jar Little.jlex.java</tt>
</UL>
